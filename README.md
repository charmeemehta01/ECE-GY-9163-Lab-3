Instructions
Launch a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Open the Assignment 4.ipynb file.
Ensure the file paths for data and models are accurately set in the code to avoid any path-related issues.
Execute the code cells in sequence to observe the results.

Dependencies
Ensure all necessary dependencies, such as Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) and machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras), are installed in your environment before running the code.
